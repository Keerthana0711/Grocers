About online shopping project in dbms

We have used Python and sqlite3 to implement our idea. The main idea is to regulate the number of agents supplying basic needs in a society. This notion will help to a greater extent in times like COVID-19 pandemic.

This project includes a LogIn/SignUp process, following up with setting up/editting the profile with user details and basic needs requirements. Then bill generation of Daily Needs at 8 AM every morning and Monthly Needs at start of the month.
